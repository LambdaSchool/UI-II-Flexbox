# User Interface Project: Great Idea Web Page

Being able to create a user interface from scratch based on a design file is considered a basic necessity for front end developers. We will be building a single page website using HTML and CSS.

Given this [design file](design-files/desktop.jpg), use HTML and CSS to build the web page layout. Remember, you can only use `display:inline-block` and box model CSS properties for this project. **Note: you are NOT permitted to use Flexbox or CSS Grid. This is an exercise in basic layout techniques.**

**Lambda Life Tip:** Use the code from your instructor's demonstration to help you tackle the objectives.

# User Interface Project II: Great Idea Web Page With Flexbox

Now that you have experienced building a layout using `inline-block`.  Lets revisit the same HTML structure and refactor our first page with flex box module.  If you didn't finish yesterday's assignment, just start from scratch or use the solution code provided to you.

Once you have finished the home page using flex box module, go build the services page based on the [design file](design-files/services-desktop-design.png) provided to you.  This time you will need to structure your own HTML in addition to using flex box module.  You have been provided all the necessary images in the `img` folder.

## To Get Started

* Fork / Clone this project into a directory on your machine.
<<<<<<< HEAD

* Open the code with your preferred integrated development environment (IDE).

* Start on the objectives

## Objectives:

Project objectives are meant to increase your knowledge by giving you practice on the principles learned earlier in the day. Aim to complete every objective on this list. Get as far as you can on the design as we will be using your work today for tomorrow's project as well.

**Watch this short guide on how to setup your project:**  [UI Project Setup 101](https://youtu.be/UU9WjpMsaLE)

- [ ] Study the [desktop design file](design-files/desktop.jpg). Visualize how you would convert the design into HTML and CSS. Make a quick sketch of how you would build the HTML structure.  Use your sketch as a plan of action for the next two objectives.  Challenge yourself to only use 10 minutes for this particular objective.

- [ ] Go to your [index.html](great-idea-website/index.html) file and build out your HTML structure. You have been provided all the content and images you need to get started inside the `index.html` file.  Start to code HTML around the content!

- [ ] Style your HTML using the [desktop design file](design-files/desktop.jpg) as a visual guide. Use any CSS properties you want for general styling but for layout, you can only use the box model (content, padding, margin, border) and `display:inline-block`.

## Stretch Goals:

Stretch goals are not required. Complete the project objectives before working on stretch. Stretch goals are not covered in the guided demo and need some research on your part. There is no particular order in this list, just pick one that sounds fun and push yourself.

- [ ] Give the navigation a background color and have it be fixed to the top of the page so that it scrolls with the user. You will want to study what z-index means in case you encounter any issues when you scroll.
- [ ] Introduce a new font family from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

- [ ] Create a new page based off of a navigation item. Create your own layout using box model and `display: inline-block;`

- [ ] Change all the image tags into background images instead

- [ ] Research CSS animations and see how you could implement some ideas when hovering over buttons or navigation items
=======
* Open the code with your preferred integrated development environment (IDE).
* Start on the objectives

## Objectives

* [ ] Home Page Refactor:
  * Note that the provided HTML is blank.  This is because I want you to use your code from yesterday if possible.  If you didn't finish, that's fine, just use the solution from yesterday
  * Refactor the home page layout with flexbox where `inline-block` was used before.
  * In your navigation elements, point the services `<a href=""></a>` to `services.html`

* [ ] Services Page Build:
  * Update the title in your newly copied services page to say `Great Idea! - Services`
  * Using the provided [design file](design-files/services-desktop-design.png), create the services page layout using flexbox and box model.
  * Wrap the great idea logo in an anchor tag and point the `href` to `index.html`
  
  **Remember, you should continue using box model properties this whole time.  Flexbox is only used for bigger layout pieces.  You will still need content width, padding, border, and margins to succeed.**

## Stretch Goals

* [ ] Create another page based on one of the navigation items in addition to services.  Try to create a layout that follows the patterns of the first two designs but with your own creative twist.  Use lorem ipsum text for all your content.
* [ ] Introduce media queries into your services page to create a mobile view that stacks all the boxes on top of each other on phone but looks like the layout file on desktop.
