        <p>IT Crowd: A story of a young man trying to find his sexuality in the uncaring Thatcher years. Warning: Contains scenes of graphic
        homoeroticism. If anyone was ever rude to me, I used to carry their food around in my trousers. Oh my God! Before you
        brought it to their table? No, after! Of course, before! Why would I do it after? If anyone was ever rude to me, I used
        to carry their food around in my trousers.</p>
        <p>Oh my God! Before you brought it to their table? No, after! Of course,
        before! Why would I do it after? It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of the month? The weekend? Oh
        really? </p>
